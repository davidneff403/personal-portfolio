		<p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
		<p>I am very happy to be applying to [Your Company] for the [entry-level position] position. I have always been interested in coding and technology. My interest in computer science started in middle school, taking a technology class and doing the Hour of Code. Since then my fascination has only grown. I went to college to chase this dream and now I am hoping the knowledge I gained there can help me to help you. I have always heard of [Your Company] and I truly feel that your innovation in the field and the values the company stand for really align with my own personal beliefs.</p>
		<p>I have taken a wide range of classes at Florence-Darlington Technical College that have given me a lot of tools I could use in this position. I went through all 3 CCNA Courses from Cisco, giving me experience building, working with, troubleshooting, and routing between networks. I also took a VoIP class which touched on some content from the CCNP exam to give me a basic understanding of VoIP telephony. In addition to my networking classes, I have also taken many coding classes learning to work with HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, SQL, AND C#. I have experienced working both in simulated environments and on physical networking hardware. I have built and taken apart PCs, used Windows and Linux, and I am certified to use Windows Server in hybrid server environments. At Florence-Darlington Technical College, I earned an AAS in Network Systems Management as well as the subsequent Fundamentals of Networking certificate. I also took on extra classes to graduate from the Web Applications and Programming certificate program.</p>
		<p>While I have not had a job in the technology field yet, I have had a lot of experience working with others and helping to manage a business that I believe would be helpful at [Your Company]. I have worked at Mellow Mushroom in Florence, South Carolina for a little over 4 years which gave me teamwork experience and taught me the importance of keeping with a job even through tough times. I have also helped my parents with their plant shop, giving me experience working with customers, learning proper packing techniques, and teaching me more about web design. This also taught me more about environmental concerns in this area. Keeping a computing environment just right is an important part of preventative maintenance which could save a company a lot of money in the long run.</p>
		<p>I really enjoy learning and I believe I am someone that could bring something to the team at [Your Company] that would be beneficial. If I am chosen for the [entry-level position] position, I can guarantee that I will give it my all to keep learning and do the best work I can with the skills I have acquired.</p>
		<p>Thank you for your time and considering my application. I look forward to hearing back from you and working for your company.</p>
		<p>Sincerely,</p>
		<p>David Neff</p>
