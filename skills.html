					<h3>Job Experience</h3>
					<img src="images/jobexperience.png" alt="The front of a generic restaurant." class="">
					<p>Because I am in school and live in a small town, I do not have a lot of professional experience yet working with technology, but I do have some job experience which I have learned from and will take the knowledge of into my future work.</p>
					<p>I am currently working at Mellow Mushroom in Florence, South Carolina. This was my first real job, and I have been working there for more than 3.5 years as of November 2025. While seating and bussing tables may not be an amazing job to do, I still appreciate having a place to work in such uncertain times. Through this experience I have met many great friends and hope to use my time there as a good reference when I decide to look for a job after college.</p>
					<p>I also help out with my parents' plant shop, <a href="https://sweetleafnursery.com">Sweet Leaf Nursery</a>, when I can. Through this experience I have learned a lot about the environment in South Carolina, how to speak with customers, proper shipping techniques, and even some website and graphical design.
					<h4>Mellow Mushroom</h4>
					<p>Position: Host / Busser</p>
					<p>Dates: April 2022-Current</p>
					<p>Address: 120 Dunbarton Dr., Florence, SC, 29501</p>
					<h4>References:</h4>

					<h3>My Current Skills</h3>
					<img src="images/currentskills.png" alt="A computer with code written on it." class="">
					<p>While in College I have learned:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>HTML5 and CSS essentials</li>
							<li>Cisco Switch and Router configuration</li>
							<li>PC Hardware and Operating Systems Troubleshooting</li>

							<li>Basic Server Administration</li>
							<li>Python</li>
							<li>SQL</li>
							<li>VoIP Telephony</li>
							<li>and more!</li>
						</ul>
					<p>These skills are just the beginning, as I have one semester after this and then I may go on to get my Bachelor's degree.</p>
					<p>Learning and expanding my toolbelt has been very exciting for me and I hope to continue my venture to gain more knowledge.</p>

					<h3>What's Next</h3>
					<img src="images/graduation.png" alt="a group of students ready to graduate." class="gradspacer">
						<ul>
							<li>Advanced Network Server Administration</li>
							<li>CompTIA Security+</li>
							<li>C#</li>
							<li>Graduation with an AAS in Network System Management, a certificate in Web Applications and Programming, and other subsequent certificate programs.</li>
							<li>and more!</li>
						</ul>
					<p>These are just some of the skills I will learn or achievements I will achieve in my next semester. Learning these skills will be essential for getting a job after college as these are core areas in my studies. I plan to graduate May 2026 and either go into a job or to another college to get my Bachelor's Degree.</p>
