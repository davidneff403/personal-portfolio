					<h3>Job Experience</h3>
					<img src="images/jobexperience.png" alt="The front of a generic restaurant." class="">
					<p>Because I am in school and live in a small town, I do not have a lot of experience yet working with technology, but I do have some job experience which I have learned from and will take the knowledge of into my future work.</p>
					<p>When I was 16 I began work at a local restaurant washing dishes, cleaning, and helping prepare food. While this job gave me a good start, the business closed down due to low demand in such a small town.</p> 
					<p>Now, I am working at Mellow Mushroom in Florence, South Carolina. I have been working there for 3 years as of April 2025. While bussing tables may not be an amazing job to do, I still appreciate having a place to work. Through this experience I have met many great friends and hope to use my time there as a good reference when I decide to look for a job after college.</p>

					<h3>My Current Skills</h3>
					<img src="images/currentskills.png" alt="A computer with code written on it." class="">
					<p>While in College I have learned:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>HTML5 and CSS essentials</li>
							<li>Cisco Switch and Router configuration</li>
							<li>PC Hardware and Operating Systems Troubleshooting</li>
							<li>Java Programming basics</li>
							<li>JavaScript essentials</li>
						</ul>
					<p>These skills are just the beginning, as I still have 3 semesters after this.</p>
					<p>Learning and expanding my toolbelt has been very exciting for me and I hope to continue my venture to gain more knowledge.</p>

					<h3>What's Next</h3>
					<img src="images/graduation.png" alt="a group of students ready to graduate." class="gradspacer">
						<ul>
							<li>Network Administration</li>
							<li>Linux Essentials</li>
							<li>Python</li>
							<li>Advanced Cisco Router Configuration</li>
							<li>and more!</li>
						</ul>
					<p>These are just some of the skills I will learn in my next semesters. Learning these skills will be essential for getting a job after college as these are core areas in my studies. Once that is completed, graduation is the biggest thing in my future. I plan to graduate May 2026 and either go into a job or go to another college to get my Bachelor's Degree.</p>
