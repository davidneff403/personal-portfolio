					<h1>Who am I?</h1>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is David Neff. I am a 21 year old student at Florence-Darlington Technical College. I am double majoring in Network Systems Management and Web Application Programming. I have had a strong interest in computer science topics since I was a child, inspecting elements of webpages and changing them on my school computers. I took a couple of courses in middle and high school learning simple code. This strengthened my interest and was the reason I decided to go for the majors I am in. After I finish my current courses, I plan to transfer to Coker University and get a bachelors degree in Cybersecurity.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am hard working and have the perseverence needed to complete my goals. I have just one semester left to complete my degree and certificate programs and I know that if I put my mind to it I can make my dreams come true.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside of school and work, I can be found at home with my family playing video games or relaxing while I crochet. I may also be out with friends going to the movies and finding ways to keep ourselves entertained in the middle of South Carolina. I really enjoy spending time with the people around me and making the most of my days. The connections I have with friends and family are very important to me and most of the things I do have them in mind. My goal is to one day be able to give back to my friends and family and help support them as they've supported me.</p>
